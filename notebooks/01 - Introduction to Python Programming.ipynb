    "# Introduction to Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem solving** is one of the most important skills that everyone should learn and practice. Learning to program (especially using Python) is an excellent opportunity to develop and practice problem-solving skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial. It can also be symbolic, such as searching and replacing text in a document, or graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What are the basic elements of a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language designed by Guido van Rossum\n",
    "- Python is easy to learn with clear, readable syntax\n",
    "- Extensive ecosystem: thousands of libraries for web, data science, automation, AI, and more\n",
    "- Large, supportive community with excellent documentation\n",
    "- Used by companies like Google, Netflix, NASA, and many others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Python.org (Traditional)\n",
    "Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download Python 3.13. During installation, **check 'Add Python to PATH'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Modern Tools (Recommended)\n",
    "Modern Python development often uses:\n",
    "- **VS Code** with Python extension (manages Python automatically)\n",
    "- **uv** - Fast Python package installer: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv\n",
    "- **Anaconda** - Good for data science: https://www.anaconda.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Installation\n",
    "Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see `Python 3.13.x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Python: Three Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Interactive Interpreter (REPL)**\n",
    "Type `python` in your terminal to start the **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop). The interpreter reads your code, evaluates it, prints the result, and loops back. Great for quick experiments!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Script Files (.py)**\n",
    "Write Python code in `.py` files and run them with `python filename.py`. This is how you build real programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Jupyter Notebooks (What you're using now!)**\n",
    "Notebooks combine code, output, and documentation in one place. Perfect for learning, data analysis, and sharing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend **Visual Studio Code** as your Python editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "Why VS Code?\n",
    "- **Syntax highlighting** makes code easier to read\n",
    "- **IntelliSense** provides code completion\n",
    "- **Integrated terminal** for running code\n",
    "- **Python extension** for debugging and testing\n",
    "- **Built-in Git** for version control\n",
    "- **Jupyter support** for notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Python extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python\n",

    "## Your First Python Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this journey, remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT copy/paste code. Type it out yourself!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing helps you learn syntax, catch errors, and build muscle memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the first program in any language is \"Hello, World!\" - a simple program that displays text. In Python:"

    "### Creating a Python Script\n",
